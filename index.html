      <p>Hello! My name is Ninio Manialag. I am currently a student at BYU–Idaho, studying Web Development through the WDD 130 course. 
  I have a strong interest in learning how websites work and enjoy building pages that are clean, functional, and meaningful.
  Aside from coding, I also enjoy serving others, reading inspiring books, and spending time with my family and friends. 
  I look forward to improving my skills and contributing positively to the digital world!</p>
