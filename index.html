    <p> Hello! My name is Ninio Manialag. I am currently a student at BYU–Idaho, studying Web Development through the
      WDD 130 course.
      I have a strong interest in learning how websites work and enjoy building pages that are clean, functional, and
      meaningful.
      Aside from coding, I also enjoy serving others, reading inspiring books, and spending time with my family and
      friends.
      I look forward to improving my skills and contributing positively to the digital world!</p>
